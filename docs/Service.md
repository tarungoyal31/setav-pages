About:
I am retired from private service I was into astrology for a very long because of my late mother. I am an economics honors graduate with 35 years of working experience. Lately especially last few years ...i started to learn and practice astrology.I started a you tube channel...Then subsequently I started an Instagram Page. Slowly both are growing ..The best part is I enjoy and feel very happy and relaxed when the person tells me that his problem is solved.I give simple remedies which doesn't involve expenses because people in distress are as it is short of money.The trust i generate and they give me is adding years to my life.I feel contented and thank almighty for giving me this opportunity to be of some kind of help to distressed and needy people.Money matters but money only doesn't matter.So much pain and agony in society is prevailing and if as an astrologer we can provide them relief and bring positive changes in their lives....our job is done.And this is exactly i am doing at present and intend to do in the future.
